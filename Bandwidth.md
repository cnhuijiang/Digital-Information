[Bandwidth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing)) (in computing) is the maximum rate of data transfer across a given path (such as network or serial cable). It is measured as an amount of data per unit of time. For example, a data rate of 1000 bps is 1000 bits per second and a data rate of 1000 Bps is 1000 bytes per second.
