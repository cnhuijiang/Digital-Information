### What is metric prefix? : A [metric prefix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix) is a [unit prefix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_prefix) that precedes a basic unit of measure to indicate a multiple or fraction of the unit. While all metric prefixes in common use today are decadic, historically there have been a number of binary metric prefixes as well.

### Hint: Killo usually means 1,000 bytes. sometimes Killo would be 1024. Since we represent things in binary which is base 2, it made sense for kilo to be a power of 2.
