## What's the bit?
* The [bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit) (a portmanteau of binary digit) is a basic unit of information used in computing and digital communications. A binary digit can have only one of two values, and may be physically represented with a two-state device. These state values are most commonly represented as either a 0 or1.
## What's the Byte?
* The [byte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte) is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits. Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures.
